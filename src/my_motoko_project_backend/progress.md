# 🌱 ICP Developer Challenge Progress Log

Hi! I'm Misty, and this is my daily log for the ICP Developer of the Month challenge.

---

## 🎉 Day 1 – Kickoff Day

- Attended the Dev Month kickoff session 🎤
- Reviewed challenge terms, rules, and prize structure 💰
- Got a breakdown of the month-long roadmap and what to expect
- Met other builders in the community 🤝
- Set up VS Code, installed DFX, and prepped for Motoko coding

---

## 🧠 Day 2 – First Coding Challenge

- Received starter Motoko code for a basic `TodoList` actor
- Learned how to use:
  - `List.map` for updating immutable lists
  - `List.reverse` and recursion to safely transform state
- Solved the challenge by writing a `completeTask(id: Nat): async Bool` function
- Realized `List.map` can’t safely mutate external variables (like `found`) due to Motoko’s functional nature
- Rewrote the function using **recursion + accumulator pattern** to track updates and build a new list
- Got a working version of:
  - `addTask`
  - `getTasks`
  - `completeTask`
- Gained confidence navigating `List`, `Time`, and `Debug` in Motoko 🧙‍♀️


---

## 🔥 Day 3 (continued from Day 2)

- Fixed completeTask logic using recursion + tuples
- Solved major Motoko pattern matching bug 💪
- Successfully deployed working backend
- Used dfx CLI to add, view, and complete tasks!
-  Practiced using `addTask` and `getTasks` to simulate a mini quest game 🧙‍♀️
- Created a list of challenge-themed tasks via the terminal:
  - "Collect mana crystals 💎"
  - "Defeat the logic bug 🐞"
  - "Train in recursion dojo 🥋"
- Confirmed each task was added correctly using `getTasks`
- Learned how to pass arguments interactively or inline with `dfx canister call`
- Felt more confident navigating the command line and calling canister methods directly

## ✅ Core Features Completed

| Feature                    | Status   | Notes |
|----------------------------|----------|-------|
| `addTask(description)`     | ✅ Done  | Includes timestamp & autogenerated ID |
| `getTasks()`               | ✅ Done  | Returns full task list |
| `completeTask(id)`         | ✅ Done  | Recursively updates task as completed |
| `deleteTask(id)`           | ✅ Done  | Skips task by ID, returns `true/false` |
| `getIncompleteTasks()`     | ✅ Done  | Filters for `completed == false` |
| Task structure includes `dueDate` | ✅ Done | Uses `Time.now() + 2 days` |

---

## 🧠 Key Learnings

- Built functional recursive helpers in Motoko (`completeTask`, `deleteTask`)
- Learned safe state transformation using `List.map`, `List.filter`, and `List.reverse`
- Practiced filtering and querying from a canister in real-time
- Built and tested logic entirely through terminal with `dfx canister call`
- Turned learning into a gamified terminal challenge with fantasy-themed tasks 💎🐉
- Successfully deployed multiple times and fixed compilation errors through debugging
- Integrated `dueDate` using `Time.now()` math in nanoseconds

---

## 🎥 Content Created

- ✅ **Day 2 Voiceover Reel**: Explained lessons and challenge experience
- ✅ **Social Post**: GitHub repo shared with dev journey & highlights

---

## 🗂 Repo Structure

- `main.mo`: All core logic inside a single actor
- `progress.md`: Logs each day’s tasks, reflections, and wins
- `README.md`: Polished with project description, how to run, and contact info

---

## 🏁 Next Steps

- [ ] Implement `getCompletedTasks()`
- [ ] Add `getOverdueTasks()` using `dueDate < Time.now()`
- [ ] Bonus: `editTaskDescription(id, newDescription)`
- [ ] Bonus: Sort tasks by `dueDate` (ascending)

---
- Implemented and tested getCompletedTasks(): returns only tasks where completed == true
- Implemented getOverdueTasks(): filters uncompleted tasks where dueDate has passed
- Implemented and tested getOverdueTasks(): filters for tasks past dueDate and not completed

## 🧾 Week 1 – Final Progress Log (Advanced To-Do List)

**Submitted:** ✅  
**Deployed:** ✅  
**GitHub:** https://github.com/rainwaters11/ICP_DevMO  
**Gist/Screenshot:** [Link to be added]

### ✔️ Core Features Completed
- [x] `addTask(description)` with auto-increment ID and dueDate
- [x] `getTasks()`: returns all tasks
- [x] `completeTask(id)`: updates task state using recursion
- [x] `deleteTask(id)`: removes task by ID using recursive filtering
- [x] `getIncompleteTasks()`: filters tasks where `completed == false`
- [x] `getCompletedTasks()`: filters tasks where `completed == true`
- [x] `getOverdueTasks()`: filters tasks where `dueDate < Time.now()`

### 🧙 Bonus Features
- [x] `editTaskDescription(id, newDescription)`: allows updates to task text
- [x] `getTasksSortedByDueDate()`: sorts all tasks from oldest to newest by `dueDate`

### 💡 Key Learnings
- List filtering, recursion, functional updates
- Using `Time.now()` to create and compare `dueDate`
- Smart testing with simulated short due times (`addTestTask`)
- Sorting with `Array.sort` and custom comparison logic
- Full canister deployment using `dfx deploy`
- Debugging and fixing compiler issues with type imports and returns

🔥 Week 1 complete. On to Week 2!
